## 🐛 Known Issues & Edge Cases

### **Potential Issues to Watch For**:

1. **Date Picker Browser Compatibility**:
   - HTML5 date input may look different across browsers
   - Safari on iOS has known issues with date inputs
   - **Mitigation**: Tested with standard HTML5 input type="date"

2. **Maid Data Structure**:
   - Maid object must have: id, name, min_salary, currency
   - **Mitigation**: Using getMaidDisplayName() utility

3. **Network Errors**:
   - Supabase API might timeout or fail
   - **Mitigation**: Error handling with try-catch and toast notifications

4. **Concurrent Bookings**:
   - Multiple sponsors might book same maid at same time
   - **Mitigation**: Database will handle concurrency, backend should add booking conflict checks

## ✅ Code Quality Checks

### **Security**:
- ✅ Authentication required before booking
- ✅ User type validation (sponsor only)
- ✅ Supabase RLS policies apply automatically
- ✅ No SQL injection risk (using Supabase client)
- ✅ Input sanitization via validation

### **Error Handling**:
- ✅ Try-catch blocks in all async functions
- ✅ Error messages shown to user via toast
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Graceful degradation if API fails

### **Accessibility**:
- ✅ Proper label associations
- ✅ aria-label attributes
- ✅ Error messages linked to fields
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Screen reader friendly

### **Performance**:
- ✅ Debounced validation
- ✅ Minimal re-renders with useState
- ✅ Dialog lazy-loaded when needed
- ✅ No unnecessary API calls
