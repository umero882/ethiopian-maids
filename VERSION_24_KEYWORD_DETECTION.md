# 🚀 Version 24 - Keyword-Based Detection

**Deployed:** Just now
**Bundle Size:** 113.1kB
**Status:** ✅ LIVE with improved detection logic

---

## 🎯 What Changed from Version 23

### Problem in v23:
The detection was using exact phrase matching (e.g., "schedule interview" as one phrase). If the message format was slightly different, it would fail.

**Example:**
- ✅ Matched: "schedule interview with Fatima" (has exact phrase "schedule interview")
- ❌ Failed: "schedule video interview with Fatima" (doesn't have exact phrase, has extra word "video" in between)

### Solution in v24:
Changed to **keyword-based detection** that looks for individual words and their combinations.

**New Logic:**
```typescript
// Checks for these keywords individually:
- hasInterview = message contains "interview"?
- hasVideo = message contains "video"?
- hasSchedule = message contains "schedule"?
- hasBook = message contains "book"?
- hasCall = message contains "call"?
- hasArrange = message contains "arrange"?
- hasMeet = message contains "meet"?

// Matches if:
1. "interview" + ("schedule" OR "book" OR "arrange" OR "video" OR "meet")
   OR
2. "video" + "interview"
   OR
3. ("schedule" OR "book" OR "arrange") + ("call" OR "video")
```

**This means ANY of these will now work:**
- "schedule interview with Fatima" ✅
- "schedule video interview with Fatima" ✅
- "book interview with Fatima" ✅
- "arrange video interview with Fatima" ✅
- "video interview with Fatima" ✅
- "I want to schedule video interview" ✅
- "book video call with Fatima" ✅
- "schedule call with Fatima" ✅

## 🔍 Enhanced Debugging

### Added Detailed Message Logging:

**At line 129-131:**
```typescript
console.log('Message:', userMessage);
console.log('Message length:', userMessage.length);
console.log('Message bytes:', Buffer.from(userMessage).toString('hex'));
```

**At line 996-1004:**
```typescript
console.log('🔍 Keyword detection:', {
  hasInterview,
  hasVideo,
  hasSchedule,
  hasBook,
  hasCall,
  hasArrange,
  hasMeet
});
```

This will show EXACTLY which keywords are detected in your message.

## 📊 Why This Should Work Now

**Your message:** "Schedule video interview with Fatima"

**Lowercase:** "schedule video interview with fatima"

**Keyword check:**
- ✅ `hasSchedule = true` (contains "schedule")
- ✅ `hasInterview = true` (contains "interview")
- ✅ `hasVideo = true` (contains "video")

**Match logic:**
```
hasInterview && hasSchedule = true && true = TRUE ✅
```

**Result:** `isMatch: true` → Interactive flow starts!

---

## 🎯 Possible Results

### ✅ BEST CASE - It Works!
**Bot shows:** Date options (1-5)
**Logs show:** `isMatch: true`
**Next:** Test complete flow (date → time → platform)

### ⚠️ PARTIAL - Detection Works But Maid Not Found
**Bot says:** "I couldn't find a maid named Fatima"
**Logs show:** `isMatch: true` but maid search failed
**Fix:** Check database for maid names

### ❌ STILL FAILING - Detection Still False
**Bot says:** "I'll connect you with our interview booking system."
**Logs show:** `isMatch: false`
**Issue:** Something's wrong with the message format
**Next:** Check the byte-level logging to see if there are hidden characters

### 🐛 ERROR - No Response
**Bot:** No reply
**Issue:** Function crashed
**Next:** Check error logs in Supabase
