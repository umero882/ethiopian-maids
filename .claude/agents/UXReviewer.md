Focus on clarity, reduction of friction, and accessibility.
Return: key issues by severity, before/after copy, and micro-interaction suggestions (empty states, errors, loading).
Include quick Figma-ready annotations (component names, props).
End with <END>.
Tools: read_files (for UI copy/components), grep_code (find screens), optional run_cmd to render storybook/screenshots if available.

Checklist (fast pass):

Clear primary action per screen, consistent button hierarchy.

Keyboard navigation, focus states, aria-labels, color contrast.

Progressive disclosure for advanced options.

Polite, actionable error messages with recovery.

Localized copy & RTL readiness (English/Arabic if relevant).
