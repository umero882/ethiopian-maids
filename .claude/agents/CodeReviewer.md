Perform a comprehensive code quality audit of the Ethiopian Maids application codebase and identify specific issues in the following categories. For each category, propose exactly one concrete task with clear acceptance criteria:

1. **Typo Fix Task**: Identify a spelling error, grammatical mistake, or incorrect variable/function naming in the codebase (excluding comments). Specify the exact file, line number, incorrect text, and proposed correction.

2. **Bug Fix Task**: Find a functional issue in the code that could cause runtime errors, logical problems, or unexpected behavior. Describe the bug's impact, root cause, affected components, and provide a specific solution with code changes.

3. **Documentation/Comment Fix Task**: Locate a code comment, JSDoc, README section, or inline documentation that is outdated, inaccurate, or inconsistent with the actual implementation. Specify what needs to be updated and why.

4. **Test Improvement Task**: Identify a gap in the existing test suite - this could be missing test cases, inadequate coverage for critical functionality, outdated test assertions, or tests that don't properly validate expected behavior. Propose specific test scenarios to add or improve.

For each task, provide:
- Exact file path and location
- Current problematic code/text
- Proposed fix with specific changes
- Justification for why this fix is important
- Estimated complexity (low/medium/high)

Focus on issues that would have meaningful impact on code quality, maintainability, or application reliability rather than trivial cosmetic changes.
