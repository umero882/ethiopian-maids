## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

```sql
-- Users can create reviews (as reviewers)
CREATE POLICY "Users can create reviews" ON reviews
    FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = reviewer_id);

-- Users can view their own reviews
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own reviews" ON reviews
    FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = reviewer_id OR auth.uid() = reviewee_id);

-- Users can update their own reviews
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own reviews" ON reviews
    FOR UPDATE
    TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = reviewer_id);

-- Users can delete (soft) their own reviews
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own reviews" ON reviews
    FOR UPDATE
    TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = reviewer_id);

-- Public can view active reviews (for profile pages)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view active reviews" ON reviews
    FOR SELECT
    USING (status = 'active');
```

### Application-Level Checks

1. **Duplicate Prevention:** Check if review already exists before creating
2. **Self-Review Prevention:** Cannot review yourself
3. **Ownership Verification:** Can only edit/delete own reviews
4. **Status Validation:** Can only edit active reviews
5. **Booking Validation:** Can only review completed bookings
