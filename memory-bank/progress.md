- ⏳ Advanced search algorithms
- ⏳ Payment processing with Stripe
- ⏳ Agency management features
- ⏳ Admin dashboard and moderation tools

### Enhancements

- ⏳ Improved error handling
- ⏳ Comprehensive form validation
- ⏳ Performance optimization for listings
- ⏳ Expanded test coverage

- ⏳ Full implementation of enhanced text tag standards across all components
- ⏳ Text internationalization preparation for future multi-language support

## Current Status

The project is in an active development phase with the following status:

1. **Frontend Framework**: Established and functional with a component-based architecture
2. **UI Implementation**: Core UI components and pages have been created
3. **Data Management**: Currently using mock data with localStorage
4. **User Flows**: Basic user flows implemented including profile completion
5. **Authentication**: Basic structure in place, awaiting Supabase integration
6. **Testing**: Initial test setup complete, coverage needs expansion

The project has a solid foundation with working UI components and pages. The main focus now should be on backend integration with Supabase and enhancing feature functionality.

## Known Issues

Based on the current implementation, potential issues include:

1. **Data Persistence**: Reliance on localStorage limits data capacity and persistence
2. **Authentication**: Without backend integration, secure authentication is not fully implemented
3. **Performance**: Large lists of maids or jobs might cause performance issues without pagination or virtualization
4. **Form Validation**: May need more comprehensive validation for form inputs
5. **Testing Coverage**: Tests are present but coverage may be limited
6. **Image Handling**: No clear implementation for image uploads and optimization

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The project has evolved through several key decisions:

1. **Technology Stack**:
   - Initial decision to use React with Vite for fast development
   - Integration of shadcn/ui components for consistent design
   - Adoption of TailwindCSS for styling

2. **Architecture Approach**:
   - Feature-based component organization
   - Page-component separation
   - Context API for state management

3. **Data Strategy**:
   - Initial use of mock data and localStorage
   - Planned migration path to Supabase
   - Structure established for different data entities

4. **User Experience**:
   - Implementation of role-based experiences
   - Profile completion gateway for structured onboarding
   - Dashboard specialization by user role

5. **Development Priorities**:
   - Focus on core UI and user flows first
   - Backend integration planned for later stages
   - Progressive enhancement of features

6. **Standards and Documentation**:
   - Establishment of text tag rules for consistency and accessibility
   - Documentation of best practices for JSX text formatting
   - Preparation for future internationalization needs
   - Focus on semantic HTML and accessibility compliance
