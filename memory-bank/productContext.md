# Product Context: Ethio-Maids Connection Platform

## Problem Statement

The domestic helper employment sector, particularly for Ethiopian workers in the GCC region, faces several challenges:

1. **Fragmented Marketplace**: There's no centralized platform specifically designed for Ethiopian domestic workers to connect with potential employers.
2. **Limited Visibility**: Maids struggle to showcase their skills, experience, and availability to a wider audience of potential employers.
3. **Inefficient Matching**: Sponsors often rely on word-of-mouth or traditional agencies, which limits their options and may not result in the best match for their needs.
4. **Lack of Standardization**: Without a structured platform, there's inconsistency in how information is presented and verified.
5. **Information Asymmetry**: Both maids and sponsors lack clear information about market rates, expectations, and available opportunities.
