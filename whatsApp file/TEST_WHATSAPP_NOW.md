## What Was Fixed

### Version 13 (Before Fix)
‚ùå HTTP 401 - "Missing authorization header"
‚ùå Twilio blocked from calling webhook
‚ùå No WhatsApp responses
‚ùå "EarlyDrop" errors in logs

### Version 14 (After Fix)
‚úÖ HTTP 200 - Success
‚úÖ Twilio can call webhook
‚úÖ WhatsApp responds normally
‚úÖ Function executes properly

### The Solution
Created `supabase/config.toml` with:
```toml
[functions.whatsapp-webhook]
verify_jwt = false  # Allow public access for Twilio
```

Deployed with:
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy whatsapp-webhook --no-verify-jwt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still Getting NO Response

**Check Twilio Configuration**:

1. **Webhook URL**:
   ```
   https://kstoksqbhmxnrmspfywm.supabase.co/functions/v1/whatsapp-webhook
   ```
   - Must be exact (no extra slashes, spaces, or characters)
   - Must use HTTPS (not HTTP)

2. **HTTP Method**: Must be **POST** (not GET)

3. **Sandbox Join Status**:
   - Send: `join [your-code]` to Twilio's WhatsApp number
   - Wait for confirmation
   - THEN test

### Problem: Delayed Response (> 30 seconds)

This might happen for the AI search (Test 3) if:
- Claude API is slow
- Network latency
- Large result set

**Solution**: The function has 25-second timeout protection. If it takes longer, you'll get an error message.

### Problem: Error Message in Response

Check the Supabase function logs:
```bash
npx supabase functions logs whatsapp-webhook
```

Look for error messages and report them.
