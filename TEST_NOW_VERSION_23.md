## 🔍 How to Check Logs

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (EASIEST)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kstoksqbhmxnrmspfywm/functions/whatsapp-webhook
2. Click on "Logs" tab
3. Look for the most recent entries

### Option 2: Check Database
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres.kstoksqbhmxnrmspfywm:zU8s5wq7lJvc5bP1@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require" NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 node -e "const {Client} = require('pg'); const c = new Client({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL}); c.connect().then(() => c.query('SELECT message_content, sender, received_at FROM whatsapp_messages ORDER BY received_at DESC LIMIT 5')).then(r => {console.log('Recent messages:'); r.rows.forEach(row => console.log('-', row.sender + ':', row.message_content.substring(0, 50), '(' + new Date(row.received_at).toLocaleTimeString() + ')')); c.end();}).catch(e => {console.log('Error:', e.message); c.end();})"
```

## 🎯 What to Look For in Logs

### ✅ GOOD - Interactive Flow Working:
```
📋 Checking for new interview request...
🔍 Checking if interview request: { original: "Schedule video interview with Fatima", cleaned: "schedule video interview with fatima" }
🔍 Interview request detection result: { isMatch: true, matchedPattern: "schedule video", ... }
✅ New interview request detected! Starting interactive flow...
👤 Extracted maid name: Fatima
```

### ❌ BAD - Detection Failing:
```
📋 Checking for new interview request...
🔍 Checking if interview request: { original: "...", cleaned: "..." }
🔍 Interview request detection result: { isMatch: false, matchedPattern: "none", ... }
Calling Claude API...
```

### ⚠️ NEUTRAL - Claude Detected But Blocked:
```
📋 Checking for new interview request...
🔍 Interview request detection result: { isMatch: false, ... }
Calling Claude API...
Claude API responded
[Response: "I'll connect you with our interview booking system."]
```
(This means detection failed, but at least Claude is blocked from asking for details)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Claude Still Asking for Dates/Times

**Symptom:** Bot asks "Could you please provide: When you'd like to have the interview..."

**Diagnosis:** Detection is failing (`isMatch: false`) AND Claude is not following the new prompt

**Fix Options:**
1. Check logs to see exact message format
2. Add your exact phrasing to detection patterns
3. Make system prompt even stronger

### Issue 2: No Response at All

**Symptom:** No message back from bot

**Diagnosis:** Function might be crashing or timing out

**Fix:** Check Supabase function logs for errors

### Issue 3: "Maid Not Found"

**Symptom:** Bot says "I couldn't find a maid named Fatima"

**Diagnosis:** Database doesn't have a maid with that name

**Fix:** Check available maid names:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres.kstoksqbhmxnrmspfywm:zU8s5wq7lJvc5bP1@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require" NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 node -e "const {Client} = require('pg'); const c = new Client({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL}); c.connect().then(() => c.query('SELECT full_name, availability_status FROM maid_profiles LIMIT 10')).then(r => {console.log('Available maids:'); r.rows.forEach(row => console.log('-', row.full_name, '(' + row.availability_status + ')')); c.end();}).catch(e => {console.log('Error:', e.message); c.end();})"
```
