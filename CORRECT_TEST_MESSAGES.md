# 📱 Correct Test Messages for Video Interview Booking

## ❌ What You're Currently Sending

**Your message:**
```
Fatima Ahmed, Hire, Abu Hamdan,0588767821,oct,28, 2pm
```

**What this triggers:** Old `book_maid` tool → "Failed to create booking" error

---

## ✅ What You Should Send Instead

For the NEW video interview booking flow to work, you need to send:

### Option 1: Simple Request
```
Schedule video interview with Fatima
```

### Option 2: Alternative Phrasing
```
Book video interview with Fatima Ahmed
```

### Option 3: Another Variation
```
I want to schedule an interview with Fatima
```

## 🎯 Why Your Message Didn't Work

**Your message:** `Fatima Ahmed, Hire, Abu Hamdan,0588767821,oct,28, 2pm`

**Emergency bypass detection looks for:**
- "schedule" OR "book" OR "arrange"
- PLUS
- "interview" OR "video"

**Your message had:**
- ✅ "Hire" (but bypass doesn't check for this)
- ❌ NO "schedule"
- ❌ NO "book"
- ❌ NO "interview"
- ❌ NO "video"

**Result:** Bypass didn't trigger → Fell through to Claude AI → Claude used old `book_maid` tool → Failed

## 🐛 If You Want to Book a Maid (Not Interview)

The old booking system (`book_maid` tool) is currently broken. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use Interview Booking
Schedule a video interview first, then book after the interview.

### Option 2: Fix the Old Booking Tool
We can fix the `book_maid` tool if you need direct hiring without interviews.

**But for now:** The interview booking flow is what's working and ready to test!
