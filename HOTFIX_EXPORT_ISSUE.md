# Hotfix: Export Issue Resolved

**Issue:** `SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/services/agencyDashboardService.js' does not provide an export named 'default'`

**Root Cause:** The transformation process removed the export statements at the end of the file.

**Fix Applied:** Added default export (named export already exists from class declaration):

```javascript
// Line 6: Named export (from class declaration)
export class AgencyDashboardService { ... }

// Line 1581: Default export for compatibility
export default AgencyDashboardService;
```

**Location:**
- Named export: Line 6 (`export class`)
- Default export: Line 1581 (`export default`)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Why Both Exports?**
- **Default export:** Used by most pages (`import AgencyDashboardService from ...`)
- **Named export:** Used by `useAgencyDashboard` hook (`import { AgencyDashboardService } from ...`)

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep -n "export" src/services/agencyDashboardService.js
6:export class AgencyDashboardService {
1580:// Default export for compatibility with default imports
1581:export default AgencyDashboardService;
```

**Import Usage:**
- Default import: 10 files ✅
- Named import: 1 file (useAgencyDashboard.js) ✅

**File Status:**
- Total lines: 1,581 (updated from 1,577)
- Named export: ✅ From class declaration (line 6)
- Default export: ✅ Added (line 1581)
- Compatibility: ✅ Works with all imports
- No duplicate exports: ✅ Issue resolved

**Testing:**
The application should now start without the export error. Run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

And navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard/agency`
