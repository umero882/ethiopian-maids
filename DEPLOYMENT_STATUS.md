## ⏳ Next Steps (Action Required)

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets 🔐

**Option A: Automated (Recommended)**
```powershell
# 1. Install GitHub CLI
winget install GitHub.cli

# 2. Authenticate
gh auth login

# 3. Run setup script
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/setup-github-secrets.ps1

# 4. Verify
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check-github-secrets.ps1
```

**Option B: Manual**
1. Go to: https://github.com/umero882/ethiopian-maids-st/settings/secrets/actions
2. Add secrets from `SETUP_GITHUB_SECRETS_NOW.md`

**Required Secrets:**
- [ ] `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- [ ] `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- [ ] `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

**Status:** ⏳ Pending - See `SETUP_GITHUB_SECRETS_NOW.md`

---

### Step 2: Monitor GitHub Actions Workflow

After secrets are set, your push to main will trigger workflows:

**Check workflow status:**
```
https://github.com/umero882/ethiopian-maids-st/actions
```

**Expected workflows:**
- ✅ CI Workflow - Build, test, lint
- ✅ Deploy Workflow - Deploy to Vercel

**Status:** ⏳ Waiting for secrets setup

---

### Step 3: Configure Vercel Project

After first successful deployment:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find: `ethiopian-maids-st` project
3. Go to: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add environment variables for all environments:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

**Status:** ⏳ Pending first deployment

---

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

After deployment completes:

```bash
# Get deployment URL from GitHub Actions or Vercel

# Run post-deployment check
npm run deploy:check https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app

# Monitor all environments
npm run deploy:health
```

**Status:** ⏳ Pending deployment
