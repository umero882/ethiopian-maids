## 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Payment Integration (HIGH PRIORITY - Security Issue)
**Current State**: Payment settings use localStorage (PCI-DSS violation)
**Required**:
- Create `src/services/paymentService.js`
- Integrate Stripe.js
- Rewrite `SponsorPaymentSettingsPage.jsx`
- Remove localStorage usage
- Use `payment_methods` table

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/paymentService.js` (NEW)
- `src/pages/dashboards/sponsor/SponsorPaymentSettingsPage.jsx` (REWRITE)
- `src/config/stripe.js` (already exists)

### 2. Real-Time Booking Updates (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current State**: Bookings don't update automatically
**Required**:
- Add Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Update `SponsorBookingsPage.jsx`
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Add real-time notifications

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Files to Modify**:
- `src/pages/dashboards/sponsor/SponsorBookingsPage.jsx`

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling (LOW PRIORITY)
**Current State**: Inconsistent error handling
**Required**:
- Add error boundaries
- Improve toast notifications
- Add logging integration
- User-friendly error messages

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Files to Modify**:
- All sponsor dashboard pages
